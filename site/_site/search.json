    "text": "What’s ruining our city’s architecture? (And how we can fix it)\nWalking around Melbourne, you might have noticed: there’s a whole lot of buildings with chunks taken out of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Brunswick to Heidelberg to South Melbourne to Richmond, this style of building permeates our streetscapes, with almost every new build taking on this architectural form.\nBut why?\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, we built our buildings upward.\nAnd not just in Melbourne, either. Cities all around the world are constructed like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Paris…\n\n\n\n\n…to London…\n\n\n\n\n…to Tokyo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd we didn’t forget how to build straight upward, either.\nThis is Austin Maynard’s ParkLife, part of Nightingale Village, built in 2022.\nIt’s one of the most iconic, well-loved, and sustainable new builds in Melbourne.\nThis is in no small part because of its consistent form: shooting straight up from the earth and toward the sky, it’s modern, striking, and environmentally friendly.\nIt was also extremely difficult to get planning approval to build.\n\n\n\n\n“[ParkLife was] a product of war with the planning process… we wasted a lot of money, council wasted a lot of time—to end up where we started.”\n– Andrew Maynard, Architect, at YIMBY Melbourne’s Unbanning Beauty\n\n\n\n\nMost builds do not get as lucky as ParkLife, though.\nInstead, they are subjected to an architectural form known as an ‘upper-level setback’, which is codified within planning controls across Melbourne.\nThis is not just a harmless piece of prescriptive design regulation: upper-level setbacks are terrible for both environmental sustainability and housing affordability.\nThey have almost no benefits, and are making our city worse.\nIn the context of dual climate and housing crises, it’s time we abolish unnecessary upper-level setbacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case against upper-level setbacks\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Upper-level setbacks increase embodied carbon\nResearchers from the University of Toronto found that almost three quarters of the embodied carbon in a given build came from reinforced concrete, slabs, and drop panels.\n“Design choices can yield large reductions in emissions,” write Rankin et al. in the Journal of Industrial Ecology.\nIn order to reduce embodied carbon, the researchers recommended the removal of setbacks.\nConcrete slab volume, they write, “is a major driver of concrete emissions and could be reduced by building without [setbacks], which increase concrete load through large transfer slabs while reducing usable space.”\n\n\n\n\nAlso in Toronto, Half Climate Design developed alternate designs for two medium-density projects affected by upper-level setback controls.\nThe analysis demonstrated that the removal of setbacks would save between 10 and 17 kg of carbon per square metre built—even without moving to the more sustainable materials this alternative design would enable.\n\n\n\n\nSetbacks also increase a building’s surface area and exposure to the elements.\nThis necessitates more thermal treatment and waterproofing, which is resource intensive and increases lifetime inefficiency of the building.\nWhich leads nicely to our next point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpper-level setbacks:\n\nincrease embodied carbon,\nincrease operational carbon emissions,\nincrease construction costs, and\nreduce housing supply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Upper-level setbacks increase operational carbon emissions\nBecause setbacks require the extension of uncovered continuous floor slabs, buildings lose thermal efficiency due to heat transfer through exposed areas and structural concrete lacking shade from overhead balconies.\nThis increases heating and cooling costs for the building throughout its lifetime, and increases electricity bills for occupants.\nAs a fun bonus, due to the temperature of continuous floor slabs, setbacks also increase the risk of mould and condensation inside apartments. Thank you planners, very cool!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Upper-level setbacks increase construction costs\nBuildings with a traditional “boxy” shape are simpler—and cheaper—to build and maintain, while more complex built forms are the exact opposite.\nUpper-level setback controls raise the per-dwelling costs, which are then passed on in the sell prices of apartments within a given project.\nThis reduces project viability, and throws up yet another barrier to the increased housing supply our city needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Upper-level setbacks reduce housing supply\nMoreover, setback requirements force developments to deliver less floor space—and therefore less housing.\nHow this happens is obvious when you look at a building with setbacks—all that empty space could have been more homes where people want to live.\n\n\n\n\nThe Half Climate Design alternate designs found that case study projects would have delivered 20% to 70% more housing if setbacks weren’t enforced.\nThe additional yield would enable housing projects to deliver more bedrooms, more homes, and more housing diversity to neighbourhoods across our city.\nBut all this is precluded by planning controls.\nWhy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe (shaky) case for upper-level setbacks"
