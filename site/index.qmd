# What's ruining our city's architecture? (And how we can fix it)

Walking around Melbourne, you might have noticed: there's a whole lot of buildings with chunks taken out of them.

From Brunswick to Heidelberg to South Melbourne to Richmond, this style of building permeates our streetscapes, with almost every new build taking on this architectural form.

But why?

Historically, we built straight upward. 

And not just in Melbourne, either. Cities all around the world are built like this.

And we didn't forget how to build straight up, either.

This is Austin Maynard's ParkLife, part of Nightingale Village, built in 2022. 

It's one of the most iconic, well-loved, and sustainable new builds in Melbourne. 

This is in no small part because of its consistent form: shooting straight up from the earth and toward the sky, it's modern, striking, and environmentally friendly.

It was also extremely difficult to get planning approval to build.

“[ParkLife was] a product of war with the planning process... we waste a lot of money, council wastes a lot of time—to end up where we started.”

This architectural form is called an 'upper-level setback', and is codified within planning controls across our city. 

But this is not just a harmless piece of prescriptive design regulation: upper-level setbacks are terrible for both environmental sustainability and housing affordability.

They have almost no benefits, and are making our city worse.

In the context of climate and housing crises, it's time we abolish unnecessary upper-level setbacks.
